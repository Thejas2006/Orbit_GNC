aarushi : 

one IMU is floating in free space. why dont u recheck ur system before submitting. also why do u have zip folder inside a foler??. it took me million years to go through each folder.
You created a static system btw. all the inputs are constants.
Even the output is varying. NO position output.

efforts : 9/10, work : 5.9/10

rishie:

u also created a static system, all the inputs are constants.
the output shows change ONLY if the inputs are changed in x-axis. remaining its not working.
change the legend also.

efforts: 9.5/10, work : 6.6/10

shruthi:
unique approach. no filtering done
acceleration output is not there.
need to check the functionality of euler angles...
dynamic , varying system -- so good there.

efforts: 8.5/10(used AI, so..), work: 7.5/10

arul:

added noise, good. everything is working but yaw isnt.
